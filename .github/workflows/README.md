# GitHub Workflows Security Improvements

## Overview

This directory contains GitHub Actions workflows that have been refactored to address security vulnerabilities related to repository secrets in pull request workflows.

## Security Issue Fixed

### Problem

The original `pr-verify.yml` workflow triggered on `pull_request` events and used repository secrets in the build job. This created a security vulnerability because:

1. **Fork PRs**: Repository secrets are not available for pull requests from forks
2. **Secret Exposure**: Malicious code in PRs could potentially access secret names
3. **Build Failures**: Legitimate PRs from forks would fail due to missing secrets

### Solution

The workflow has been consolidated into a single comprehensive workflow:

1. **`pr-verify.yml`** - Complete verification (lint, type-check, format, build) that runs on all PRs

## Workflow Structure

### `pr-verify.yml`

- **Trigger**: `pull_request` (all PRs)
- **Jobs**: lint, type-check, format, build (all independent, self-contained)
- **Security**: Uses dummy environment variables for build testing
- **Setup**: Each job includes complete Node.js and pnpm setup
- **Build**: Tests build process without exposing real secrets

### Standalone Workflows

- **`lint.yml`** - Linting on push to main/master
- **`build-verification.yml`** - Build verification on push to main/master
- **`check-format.yml`** - Prettier formatting check on push to main/master
- **`type-check.yml`** - TypeScript type checking on push to main/master

All workflows are **self-contained** with their own setup steps for optimal performance and reliability.

## Security Features

### Build Testing Benefits

- Tests the complete build process for all PRs
- Uses dummy environment variables to avoid exposing secrets
- Ensures build compatibility without security risks
- Works for both internal PRs and fork PRs

### Environment Variables

The build job uses dummy values for testing:

```yaml
env:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: 'https://dummy-project.supabase.co'
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: 'dummy-anon-key-for-build-testing'
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: 'dummy-service-role-key-for-build-testing'
  DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL: 'postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dummy_db'
  SUPABASE_DB_POOL_URL: 'postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/dummy_db_pool'
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: 'http://localhost:3000'
```

This allows testing the build process without exposing real secrets.

## Environment Variables

The build job uses dummy values for testing (no real secrets required):

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Dummy Supabase project URL
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Dummy Supabase anon key
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Dummy Supabase service role key
- `DRIZZLE_DATABASE_URL` - Dummy database connection for migrations
- `SUPABASE_DB_POOL_URL` - Dummy pooled database connection
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` - Dummy site URL

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Basic checks vs. secret-dependent operations
2. **Self-Contained Jobs**: Each job has complete setup for reliability
3. **Conditional Execution**: Only run sensitive operations for trusted sources
4. **Proper Caching**: Optimize build times with pnpm caching
5. **Security-First Design**: Use `pull_request_target` for secret access
6. **Parallel Execution**: Independent jobs can run simultaneously

## Workflow Architecture

### Self-Contained Job Pattern

Each job follows this pattern for optimal performance:

```yaml
jobs:
  job-name:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Setup pnpm
        uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 10
          run_install: false
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'pnpm'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
      - name: Run task
        run: pnpm <command>
```

## Migration Notes

- Existing PRs will continue to work
- All PRs (including forks) will run complete verification (lint, type-check, format, build)
- Build testing uses dummy values for security
- All workflows are now self-contained and reliable
- Improved caching and performance across all workflows

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:

- Manual approval for build jobs on fork PRs
- More granular secret access controls
- Automated security scanning in the build workflow
- Matrix builds for testing multiple Node.js versions
